# Public Transport App

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/a72a32ed-7d25-4e0f-b1b4-cf3080f8aed5/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/oepnv/deploys)

PWA for getting current departures and journeys for VAG Nuremberg (German) Public Transport System. 

## ⚠️ Note

This App uses inoffical APIs and it's just a private project of me. I don't recommend using the API's in production, because they could change & break in the future.

## Install instructions

Clone this repo and type in this command inside the folder to install all the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

to start a local server (localhost:8080) with the app running, type:
```
npm start
```

to build a ```./dist``` folder for production, run:
```
npm run build
```
